Final Project - Peg Game

Programmed by Luke Schrezenmeier, Rich Bui, and Kinsey Vo

This program uses search algorithms from "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" to play the Peg Game.

Problem:
    Peg Game is most commonly played on a triangular board that contains 15 holes and 14 pegs. The 14 pegs can be
    placed in any order on the board. The initial state would be 14 pegs placed into the holes, with one hole
    remaining empty. The goal state is when only one peg is left remaining on the board, in any hole.

Rules/How to Play:
    You jump, horizontally or diagonally, and remove pieces. When a peg is jumped over, that peg is removed
    from the game.

Approach:
    Pegs are represented as 0 and 1 where 0 means the hole is empty and one means there is a peg in the hole.
    The rows of the board is represented as a tuple of tuples.
    Example: ((0), (1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1, 1))
    
    Actions are also represented as tuples.
    Example: ((2, 0), (0, 0))
    (2, 0) means we want to take the peg from row 3, column 1 and place it into row 1 column 1 (represented as (0, 0)).
    [Python uses 0-based indexing]
    The peg at (1, 0), aka the peg in between (2, 0) and (0, 0), will be removed since it was the peg that was jumped over.
    Resulting state after example valid action: ((1), (0, 1), (0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1, 1))

Evaluation:
    We used both BFS and A* search. BFS was not optimal due to the number of nodes that it exapnds.
    A* was more efficient because it relies on its heuristic to guide its decision making. Our heuristic
    function focuses on keeping track of the number of open pegs in the game state as well as the number
    of stranded pegs. THe more open pegs, the more optimal the score. If there are stranded pegs, then
    the heuristic score will be worse.
    In terms of time, BFS resulted in 13.70 seconds while A* resulted in 0.0049 seconds.

Programming project 2 - Game of Nim

Programmed by Luke Schrezenmeier, Rich Bui, and Kinsey Vo

This program uses the game algorithms from "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" to play the Game of Nim.

Each state is represented by a list which contains the number of objects in each pile/row.
Example: [5, 3, 1] represents 5 objects in the first row, 3 in the second and 1 in the third row

An action is represented by a 2-tuple (r, n) where r represents the row number and n represents the number of objects to remove.
Example: (1, 2) meants removing 2 objects from the row with index 1 (the second row since Python uses 0-based indexing)

RULES/HOW TO PLAY:
1) Set up game board/field by creating rows of objects
2) Players take turns taking any number of objects from one of the piles
3) Game ends and a player loses when they take the last object on the board/field
